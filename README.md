# LiveViewModel

LiveViewModel is an Elixir library for building servers that power interactive web and mobile applications. It offers an alternative approach to state management and client-server communication, particularly suited for applications that don't rely on server-side HTML rendering.

## Key Concepts

- **Centralized State Management**: Application state is maintained on the server, reducing complexity in state synchronization.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Clients dispatch events to the server, which handles them and updates the state accordingly.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The server pushes state changes to clients, facilitating real-time interactivity.
- **Simplified Client Logic**: Client-side code primarily focuses on rendering state and dispatching events.
- **Platform Agnostic**: Suitable for web applications and mobile apps that manage their own UI rendering.

## How It Works

1. Clients send events to the server
2. The server processes events and updates the application state
3. Updated state is sent back to clients for rendering

This approach aims to reduce the complexity often found in managing state across both client and server in traditional web and mobile applications.

## Use Cases

LiveViewModel is particularly well-suited for:
- Mobile applications that handle their own UI rendering
- Web applications requiring real-time updates
- Scenarios where a unified backend can serve multiple client types (web, mobile, etc.)

## Comparison to LiveView

While LiveViewModel shares similar goals with Phoenix LiveView, it takes a different approach:

- LiveView manages both server logic and view presentation in Elixir, primarily for web applications
- LiveViewModel handles server logic in Elixir but relies on client-side code for rendering, making it adaptable for both web and mobile platforms

This distinction allows LiveViewModel to be used in scenarios where full server-side rendering is not possible or desirable, such as in native mobile applications.
